<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For over a decade, Indonate has responded to the hunger crisis, increase of unemployment rate and families without adequate shelter or heating by providing food, clothes and money to people in need through a nationwide network of campaigns. Today, Indonate is the nationâ€™s largest domestic hunger-relief organizationâ€”a powerful and efficient network across the country. As the coronavirus pandemic brought record unemployment and instability, Indonate network rose to meet the need. Last year, Indonate network served 1000 families.
